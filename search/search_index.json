Notice !!!</p> <p>The rest of this lab is going to be instructor led to showcase some of the abilities of COSMOS. If you are not doing the labs live, each of the steps needed in future labs will be clearly defined, so you will be able to follow along at that time, but you are encouraged to follow along with the video of this portion of the class. </p>"}]}
