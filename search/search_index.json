It's designed to be a highly reusable, scalable, and configurable system that can support various spaceflight missions, including satellites, spacecraft, and other space-related applications. The cFS consists of a core set of reusable software components known as the Core Flight Executive (cFE), which provides the infrastructure for building flight software applications. These applications can perform various functions such as data collection, spacecraft control, and communication.</p> <p>One of the key features of the cFS is its modular architecture, which allows developers to add or modify components according to the specific needs of their mission without altering the core system. This modularity and configurability make the cFS a cost-effective and efficient solution for spaceflight software development.</p> <p>The cFS is released under the NASA Open Source Agreement (NOSA), making it freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This openness has facilitated a growing community of users and contributors from NASA, other government agencies, industry, and academia, who collaborate to improve and expand the system's capabilities.</p> <p>By providing a robust, flexible foundation for flight software development, the cFS supports NASA's missions and objectives in exploring space, advancing our understanding of the universe, and developing the technologies needed for future space exploration.</p>"},{"location":"cfs/#deploying-nasas-cfs","title":"Deploying NASA's cFS","text":"<pre><code>docker pull hackethos/cfs\n</code></pre> Pulling cFS Docker Container <pre><code>docker run --cap-add CAP_SYS_RESOURCE --net=openc3-cosmos-network --name cfs -p1234:1234/udp -p1235:1235 --rm hackethos/cfs\n</code></pre> Starting cFS Docker Container cFS Container Running <p><code>docker network inspect openc3-cosmos-network</code></p> <p>cFS Container IP</p> <p> </p> cFS Container IP Address <p>Operator Container IP</p> <p> </p> OpenC3 Operator Container IP Address <pre><code>./openc3.sh cli generate plugin CFS\n</code></pre> <p> </p> Generating cFS Plugin for COSMOS <pre><code>cd openc3-cosmos-cfs/\n../openc3.sh cli generate target CFS\n</code></pre> <p> </p> Generating cFS Target <p>Now, in your favorite text editor of choice, open the <code>plugin.txt</code> file and replace the contents with the following:</p> <pre><code>VARIABLE ip 127.0.0.1\nVARIABLE port_tm 1235\nVARIABLE port_tc 1234\nVARIABLE cfs_target_name CFS\n\nTARGET CFS &lt;%= cfs_target_name %&gt;\n# hostname   write_dest_port   read_port   write_src_port   interface_address   ttl   write_timeout   read_timeout   bind_address\nINTERFACE &lt;%= cfs_target_name %&gt;_INT udp_interface.rb &lt;%= ip %&gt; &lt;%= port_tc %&gt; &lt;%= port_tm %&gt; nil nil 128 nil nil\n  MAP_TARGET &lt;%= cfs_target_name %&gt;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>cd targets/CFS/cmd_tlm/\nrm *\ntouch cfs_cmds.txt cfs_tlm.txt to_lab_cmds.txt\n</code></pre> <p> </p> Creating Empty Files for Packet Definitions <p>Open the file <code>to_lab_cmds.txt</code> and insert the following content.</p> <pre><code>COMMAND CFS TO_LAB_ENABLE BIG_ENDIAN \"Enable telemetry\"\n  #

It is an evolution of the COSMOS software initially developed by Ball Aerospace, which has been widely used in the space industry for satellite command and control. COSMOS provides a comprehensive suite of tools for mission planning, telemetry and command processing, data analysis, and system simulation, making it a versatile solution for managing space missions.</p> <p>The transition to OpenC3 represents a shift towards a more open and collaborative approach to space mission control software. OpenC3 aims to foster a community where users and developers can contribute to the development and improvement of COSMOS, ensuring it remains a state-of-the-art tool for mission control. This open-source philosophy allows for greater innovation, adaptability, and cost efficiency, as users can customize the software to meet their specific mission requirements without the constraints of proprietary software licenses.</p> <p>COSMOS under OpenC3 includes features such as:</p> <ol> <li>Real-time telemetry processing: It can process and display telemetry data in real time, allowing mission operators to monitor the status and health of their spacecraft.</li> <li>Command and control capabilities: Operators can send commands to their spacecraft, automate command sequences, and ensure the safety and success of their missions.</li> <li>Data analysis and visualization: COSMOS provides tools for analyzing telemetry data, generating reports, and visualizing data trends, which are crucial for mission analysis and decision-making.</li> <li>System simulation: It can simulate spacecraft behavior and mission scenarios, helping teams test and validate their operations before execution.</li> </ol> <p>By providing these capabilities within an open-source framework, OpenC3's COSMOS enables a wide range of entities, from small startups to educational institutions and research organizations, to access sophisticated mission control software that was once the domain of large aerospace corporations and government agencies.
